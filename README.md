# MutantTD_Draft1

## Assigned:
 - Theme: Manipulate probabilities and genetic mutation
    - idea:
        1. realize that mutation is a change of DNA sequence.
        2. realize that not all mutation are useful, but without mutation people also cannot survive. 
 - Advanced feature: Game tools 
 - Prototype: Tower Defense

## Plan for draft1:
    - create 3 basic types of tower. (pure red, green and blue).
        - have simple DNA sequence. 
    - create different types of monsters. 
        - example: circles. RGB(128,0,0) - resistance for red - 128/(2*256) = 25%
    - for each level completed, player will get MutantPoints. 
    - use firebase for login, and record player level and MutantPoints.
