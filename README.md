## Assigned:
 - Theme: Manipulate probabilities and genetic mutation
    - idea:
        1. realize that mutation is a change of DNA sequence
 - Advanced feature: Game tools 
 - Prototype: Tower Defense

## Plan:
- create 3 basic types of tower. (pure red, green and blue).
        - have simple DNA sequence. 
- create different types of monsters. 
        - example: circles. RGB(128,0,0) - resistance for red - 128/(2*256) = 25%
- for each level completed, player will get MutantPoints. 
- use firebase for login, and record player level and MutantPoints.
